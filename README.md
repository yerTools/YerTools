# Hello World!

I am Felix Mayer, and currently I am working on my biggest project yet. >>[**`UIX`**](https://github.com/yerTools/UIX)<<  
It's an easy to use CMS with a focus on blazing fast performance. It should be platform independent and run on nearly every end user device. [Check it out](https://github.com/yerTools/UIX) if you want more information.

## YerTools - What is it?
This is a collection of standalone tools/libraries i wrote, which aren't big enough for their own repository.
Everything is licensed under the [MIT-License](https://github.com/yerTools/YerTools/blob/master/LICENSE.md), so have fun trying it out! :)

## Who am I?
I'm Felix Mayer, born 1998 in bavaria, germany.  
I was a full stack developer for nearly 4 years, got a degree as `Computer Science Expert` with the subject area `Software Development` but quit my job to start studying `Computer Science` (Bachelor of Science) at the `University of Applied Sciences` in Kempten.

I was interested in computers and programming long before I started working and that's the reason why i now want to expand my knowledge further.
I'm also one of the persons who want to know exactly how certain parts work, so I write a lot of random things in my spare time.

My big project, [UIX](https://github.com/yerTools/UIX) (click it :blush:), is my first try for building a small business or at least build up a small community.

## Why did i create this repository?
As a full time developer I wrote a lot of code and many libraries.
So I thought everyone could benefit if I share my knowledge and work with the open source community.  
The code you see here wasn't developed while I was paid and I lost a lot of my private work, thats why it's currently a little bit empty here, but I'm sure it will grow eventually.

## How to get in touch
You have any idea, improvement, bug report or just want to write something to me?  
You can send me an E-Mail: [FelixM@yer.tools](mailto:FelixM@yer.tools), get in touch via Twitter: [@yerTools](https://twitter.com/yerTools) or here on [GitHub](https://github.com/yerTools).

## Want to support me?
Ok, wow ... that's a really nice thing of you but at the moment I'm totally fine. But you can share this repository if you like it or open issues if you found a bug.

If you want additional functionality/more features you can gladly open a [pull request](https://github.com/yerTools/YerTools/pulls) or just write me an [E-Mail](mailto:FelixM@yer.tools). :)
